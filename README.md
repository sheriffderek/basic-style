basic | style
=============

a carefully considered set of style rules to make *baby-talking* to computers, notably more fun.


*basic-style*:

1. is usable, although it's family members are not.
2. currently assumes preprocessing with stylus
3. assumes auto-prefixing will occur sometime before production use
4. disregards the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser
